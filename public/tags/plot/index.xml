      <description>Abstract This is a data analysis of the outbreaks in Toronto health institutions within 2020 using ggplot2 (Wickham (2016)) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. (2019)) within R Markdown (JJ Allaire (2020)). An overview of the paper includes an outbreak distribution seen within healthcare settings which shows majority of reported outbreaks occurring within long-term care homes raising concerns about the infection prevention and control procedures within these facilities. When the dataset was filtered to examine only COVID-19 outbreaks within all institutions, the trend of outbreak occurrence date displays the pattern of the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>
